Tour of all imaging suites, including MRI, CT, Nuclear Medicine, Mammography, Fluoroscopy, X-ray, Ultrasound, and Interventional Radiology

- **Clinical Setting:**  
We toured the full radiology facility with Reva. The environment was active but welcoming, and each area showcased ongoing or prepped procedures.  As we arrived when the some procedures where ongoing it was kind of hard to follow and most people there are very busy so asking questions feel as annoyance at the beginning. We also met Brian Peters, a radiology resident, who discussed MRI image review and safety protocols.

- **Cases Observed:**  
1. **MRI Brain Scan** – Conducted on a Siemens MAGNETOM Aera (1.5T) or Skyra (3T) system. The case involved a patient with headache symptoms; sagittal T1-weighted imaging with contrast was likely investigating stroke or lesion presence.  
  2. **Interventional Radiology** – A female patient received a fluoroscopic contrast injection into the right shoulder joint, likely to evaluate joint integrity or impingement.  
  3. **CT Scan** – A case evaluating migration of a birth control implant from the shoulder to axillary region, performed on a Siemens SOMATOM CT system. The foreign body was later confirmed manually by a nurse.  
  4. **Ultrasound Tour** – We reviewed general abdominal and vascular imaging workflows, explored various transducer types, and discussed the physics behind Doppler and B-mode imaging.  
  5. **Nuclear Medicine** – A gamma camera was present (powered off). Becky, the technologist, discussed radionuclide handling and safety protocols; Tc-99m generators (“cows”) were not in use.
  6.  **Mammography Suite** – We observed the system used for breast imaging and discussed compression paddles and patient comfort considerations.  
  
  
  
## Procedures and Protocols

- **Procedure Workflow:**  
	 - The MRI technologist demonstrated how image stacks are viewed across coronal, sagittal, and axial planes. Mid-scan, contrast was administered, I think it was gadolinium-based, for enhanced lesion visibility.  
	- IR staff performed shoulder arthrography under live fluoroscopy. We noticed they took only a couple of shots of the shoulder just to confirm the needle went where expected, they applied very little xray dose.
	- In CT, standard positioning and scout imaging preceded the scan. Although we arrived when scan was done and nurse was helping the patient get out of the suite.
	- The ultrasound suite discussion included probe selection and machine configurations.
	- In Mammography, Brian described how **compression paddles** ensure image clarity while balancing patient discomfort, and highlighted the importance of **dose minimization** and **precision in positioning**.


- **Notable Protocol Aspects:**  
  - **MRI Safety**: Emphasis on Zones 1–4, the 5 Gauss line, and emergency response (e.g., remove patients from Zone IV before CPR).  
  - **Contrast Use**: Gadolinium in MRI; iodinated contrast in IR/CT.  
  - **Ultrasound Transducers**: We learned about linear, convex, and phased arrays and their applications.  
  - **Gamma Camera**: Though offline, we discussed how radiopharmaceuticals are prepared, labeled, and tracked.
- **Mammography Technique**: Use of low-energy X-rays and physical compression to reduce motion blur and enhance tissue contrast.

## Interaction with Radiology Professionals

- **Staff Engagement:**  
  Reva led the facility tour then handed over Brian. He stopped to explain imaging protocols briefly and answer our questions in each modality. In MRI, the technologist paused to describe the scan interface.  
  Brian Peters also attempted to demonstrate reading MR images but was unable due to database issues. Still, he offered valuable insights into clinical radiology workflows and patient throughput.

- **Reading Room Experience (if applicable):**  
  Brief visit to the MRI reading room; we discussed imaio.com as a resource and MRI viewer interfaces. Unfortunately, live image review was not possible due to DB access issues.

## Reflections and Insights

- **Clinical vs. Academic Knowledge:**  
  Witnessing a live shoulder fluoroscopy case and MRI contrast injection contextualized concepts we’ve studied in PHY 566/567. For example, seeing the effect of contrast timing and image plane navigation in T1-weighted MR imaging was just as Dr. Nichols explained. I've found myself revisiting these lectures and Bushberg book.

- **Professional Development Takeaways:**  
  In general, the tour showed interdepartmental communication and imaging safety. I think, understanding how equipment capabilities (e.g., 3T MRI for higher SNR) influence modality selection deepened my appreciation for the physicist’s advisory role.

- **Personal Reflections:**  
    I was excited to see systems I had only read about. Seeing them integrated into everyday care reinforced my desire to work in this area of the field. Contrasted with TG-51 shadowing we did earlier this month I liked better all these modalities and the dark room experience was great. I also reflected on how unpredictable hospital dynamics can be, such as database failures, and the adaptability that professionals demonstrate in response.
