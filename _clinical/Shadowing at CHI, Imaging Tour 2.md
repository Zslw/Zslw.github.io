 Interventional Radiology, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Nuclear Medicine, PET/CT, and 3D Printing.

- **Clinical Setting:**  
  This was our second visit, taking place on a Friday afternoon. The radiology residents had already left for the day, so Reva led our group (me, Jiji, and Shankar) through the entire department. The pace was more relaxed than my first visit, which gave us more time for questions and technical observations.

- **Cases Observed:**  
  1. **Interventional Radiology** – Percutaneous transhepatic access to the biliary system under fluoroscopy. The patient was under general anesthesia.  
  2. **MRI Knee Scan** – A case of persistent knee pain. We observed different sequences including Proton Density (PD).  
  3. **Nuclear Medicine & PET/CT** – No live case, but we reviewed PET/CT fusion images and discussed radiotracers.  
  4. **3D Printing Lab** – Observed printers in action and discussed anatomical modeling.

## Procedures and Protocols

- **Procedure Workflow:**  
  In IR, we observed the team performing a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage using fluoroscopic guidance. The control room displayed real-time imaging via the image intensifier (II) as the physicians struggled with access. Everyone in the operating suite wore leaded vests. The staff outside the room discussed potentially replacing their current vests, it seems that the clinical wear-and-tear is real and the culture of the team is friendly.  

  In MRI, Ashley was working on a 1.5T Siemens scanner scanning a patient's knee for pain. She explained that they rotate through various imaging sequences (T1, T2, Proton Density) depending on the anatomy and contrast required. At the time, we observed a PD scan which was useful for evaluating cartilage and soft tissue, so no contrast needed. She noted that the 3T system was not used in this case due to the patient’s body size and the coil limitations for certain exams.  

  In Nuclear Medicine, Becky provided an in-depth walkthrough of their radiopharmaceutical handling. We visited the PET/CT control room and viewed sample fusion images—where PET’s metabolic signal overlays on CT anatomy. She explained attenuation correction using CT and identified common tracers used at their facility, including FDG, DOTATATE, and possibly Iodine-based isotopes.  

  The tour concluded in the 3D printing lab, where we saw anatomical models being fabricated using PETG material. A researcher explained the workflow from image segmentation to printer setup and emphasized software like 3D Slicer used for model design.

- **Notable Protocol Aspects:**  
  - IR staff followed radiation safety procedures (lead aprons, minimized exposure time).  
  - MRI sequence selection and machine choice (1.5T vs. 3T) was based on patient factors.  
  - In PET/CT, attenuation correction and tracer selection are the main factors to get a good image.  
  - 3D printing requires precise segmentation and can take 12–18 hours per model depending on complexity.

## Interaction with Radiology Professionals

- **Staff Engagement:**  
  Reva again led the entire tour and was coordinating access. The IR nurse provided helpful commentary on the case and procedural challenges. Ashley, the MRI technologist, was open, informative, and fielded multiple technical questions about workflow and system preferences. Becky in Nuclear Medicine took her time walking us through the hot lab and fusion imaging stations.

- **Reading Room Experience (if applicable):**  
  Not applicable for this visit, as the residents were off-duty and no PACS review occurred.

## Reflections and Insights

- **Clinical vs. Academic Knowledge:**  
  This time, we saw more of the operational side of imaging. Like machine selection, sequence choice, and contrast decisions made in real-time. Ashley’s commentary on choosing 1.5T vs. 3T for comfort and coil fit helped me see practical limitations and how physics and engineering solve them.  Seeing PET/CT fusion images gave life to attenuation correction concepts and radiotracer behavior we’ve studied.

- **Professional Development Takeaways:**  
  I learned a lot about interdepartmental workflow and modality-specific considerations (e.g., patient size, contrast use, scan duration). The relaxed pace of the visit allowed for more in-depth conversations that were insightful from both technical and cultural standpoints—like the IR team's casual discussion on upgrading vests.

- **Personal Reflections:**  
  It was rewarding to return to the same facility and feel more confident navigating both the environment and the equipment. Each revisit helps familiarize more with the environment, this time I could observe some other aspects of the field like human interaction and daily talks with physics on the side! I also found it meaningful that staff were still willing to teach and share even late on a Friday.
