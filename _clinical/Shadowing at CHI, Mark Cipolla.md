Source exchange [I125] for (HDR) Brachytherapy, we followed a checklist with rigorous daily and quarterly quality assurance (QA) checks, calibration procedures, and emergency protocols.

- **Clinical Setting:**  

Brachytherapy Calibration, Source Exchange and Safety revision.
We started with safety and usage of the computer and suite, then followed by dosage calculation and Source Activity Verification. Then Linerarity Check (Dwelling Times) of the source at given distance. Finally shielding check and Transfer Cable Length and system updates.

## Procedures and Protocols

- A. Daily Quality Assurance (QA) Checks and Safety Protocols:

	- Survey Meter Functionality: Using a low-activity Cesium-137 check source. As stated, "We should get a reading of .9 m per hour. And if we do, then we know this survey meter is working properly." This ensures accurate detection of radiation levels.
	- HDR unit components functional before treatment
	
	- Check Functionality:
		- Radiation Monitor (RAM): Proper illumination.
		- Audio-Visual Monitors: 
		- Source Exposure Indicator Light 
		- Indexer Image: positioning
		- Door Interlock: Treatment stops if door is not locked
		- Interrupt Button
		- Emergency Stop Buttons
		- Backup Battery Test (Quarterly)

	- Decay Correction: The system accounts for the decay of the source, with modern systems correcting for decay "to the actual time that you bring up the plan," an improvement over older systems that only corrected twice a day (AM/PM).


- B. Calibration Process
	- Position Calibration: An initial check involved adjusting the position calibration due to a "millimeter off the center of each position for the treatment," indicating a high degree of precision required.
	- Ion Chamber and Electrometer: The core of the calibration involves plugging the afterloader into an ion chamber connected to an electrometer outside the control room.
	- Finding the "Sweet Spot": The "sweet spot" of the ion chamber is the position where the maximum response (highest dose rate, measured in nanoamperes) is obtained. 
	- Source Activity Verification: The measured source activity is compared to the manufacturer's stated activity. We got an agreement- "between .17% which is really impressive. I mean it has to be." -in accuracy of the calibration.
	- Current vs. Exposure Measurements: The calibration can be done by measuring current (nanoamperes) or by exposure (integrating charge over time). Both methods are used for verification. "It's not necessary that you do it this way, but I kind of do it both ways to make sure there isn't some something strange going on with the reading that we're getting here."
	- Linerarity Check (Dwelling Times): The linearity of the dose delivered is checked by varying dwelling times (e.g., 15, 30, 60 seconds, 5 minutes) and measuring the dose. "The more time it's dwelling, the more dose it's giving." This confirms predictable dose delivery.
- Source Information Update: After calibration, the new source serial number and manufacturer's calibration data (activity, date, and time, including adjustment for Central European Time) are updated in the spreadsheet.

- C. Radiation Shielding and Environmental Survey
Shielding Survey: After calibration, a quick survey of the shielding is conducted around the treatment room. This includes checking the door, control panel, surrounding rooms (LINAC, storage), and even the floor above (conference room).
Low Exposure Levels: The measured values were very low, "in the magnitudes of micro rankings per hour... 0.06 to mill ranking per hour in the control panel and the highest it gets it was like .7 mill ranking per hour exposure outside of the in the storage room." These low readings indicate effective shielding, likely "in agreement with the law."

- D. Ancillary Checks
Transfer Cable Length: The length of the transfer cables (37 in total) is checked to ensure they "haven't bent, they haven't changed length with the years of use or any deformation," which is critical for accurate source positioning.
System Updates: The updated calibration values are entered into both the "treatment planning system and into the treatment machine itself."


## Interaction with Radiology Professionals

I had the opportunity to shadow Dr. Mark Cipolla. He conducted the source exchange while explaining and clarifying my questions very detaily. He showed me the instruments and measurements needed to make this process doable in about 3 hours. 


## Reflections and Insights

- **Clinical vs. Academic Knowledge:**  
	In class we had visited all the issues where brachytherapy could go wrong. In the clinic, I saw safety highlighted and the characteristics of a I125 source being characterized and match to manufacturers for use and QA.

- **Professional Development Takeaways:**  
	I've found this shadowing particularly useful as it got me closer to Brachytherapy which isn't as common as external beam therapy. The fact that I was able to follow a source exchange from start to finish. So I now feel more confortable I were to do that again. So far I'm missing the performance of HDR on a real case but I'll participate in one as soon as I have the chance.
