Test run of water tank phantom for LINAC commissioning data collection.


# Clinical Shadowing Report â€“ Radiotherapy Dosimetry

**Student Name:** *Daniel Juarez*  
**Date of Shadowing:** 2024-11-17  
**Location:** Methodist Estabrook Cancer Center  
**Supervising Physician/Technologist:** Dr. Xin Wang  
**Duration:** 3 hours

## Overview of the Clinical Event

- **Clinical Setting:**  
  Radiotherapy physics team preparing LINAC commissioning measurements using a water tank phantom under guidance of a board-certified medical physicist.

- **Cases Observed:**  
  1. Water tank phantom setup and calibration.  
  2. Detector positioning and 1D/3D alignment techniques.  
  3. Initial beam data collection and troubleshooting anomalies in dosimetry readings.

## Procedures and Protocols

- **Procedure Workflow:**  
  The water tank phantom was positioned within the LINAC treatment room and aligned using optical and mechanical tools. The radiation detector was calibrated and positioned, followed by initial measurements to ensure detector consistency. A brief scan sequence was performed to assess beam characteristics such as central axis dose, profile symmetry, and signal quality.

- **Notable Protocol Aspects:**  
  - Use of water for its tissue-equivalent properties due to its effective atomic number, mass attenuation, and absorption coefficients.  
  - 1D calibration: set SSD, optically and mechanically aligned detector, positioned chamber using optical tools.  
  - 3D calibration: centered the detector and ensured phantom alignment within the water tank.  
  - Noted a step-like curve with side wobbling in readings, which was corrected by repositioning the outer chamber.  
  - Air bubbles introduced by the phantom's pump required troubleshooting to stabilize measurements.
