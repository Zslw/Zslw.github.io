# My Bio

I grew up in Puebla, Mexico, and graduated from the Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP) in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Physics. 
My interest in the physical sciences and their application to healthcare was deeply influenced by personal experiences, 
such as my grandmother’s battle with undiagnosed pancreatic cancer. In winter 2021, my mother and I struggled to find proper medical attention to diagnose my grandmother as she grew ill. Unfortunately, pancreatic cancer was not detected until the medics performed a biopsy, but that was too late as she died later that day at the hospital. 
In Medical Physics we want to help people through physics - either with therapy or with better diagnoses - personally I seek excellence in diagnoses so people with this illness can be promptly treated.

In the past I experienced what it is like to being useful and helping others. I worked as
a medical emergency technician, and I saw what working in the medical field can do for
those in need. Also, I studied physics and took, to a great extent, topics related to
modern physics and photonics.

My undergraduate studies involved hands-on research under Dr. César Márquez Beltrán at the Instituto de Física, BUAP. I worked on synthesizing gold and silica nanoparticles and analyzing their optical properties using UV-Vis, XRD, and SEM. Our goal was to understand how these properties could enhance imaging techniques, with potential applications in non-invasive cancer diagnostics. This research also sparked my curiosity about particle physics, leading me to present my work on the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model with CP violation at the 2019 Congreso Nacional de Física.
During my undergraduate years, I also met my wife, Karla, whose passion for astronomy and beauty inspired my own interest in arts and sciences. Together, we shared evenings observing the night sky, deepening both my appreciation for astronomy and my dedication to understanding the broader physical world.

Following graduation, I expanded my skillset outside academia, working as a Senior Analyst in the financial sector. This role allowed me to lead projects in database migration, AML compliance, and statistical analysis. I developed proficiency in Python, R, and SQL, as well as in using VBA to streamline workflows. While these experiences honed my analytical abilities, my desire to make a tangible impact in healthcare drove me back to science, specifically medical physics.

I consider that some of my main strengths are: laboratory work, accuracy, solving
technical diﬃculties, teamwork, and rigor. During my studies, I always enjoyed and
excelled in laboratory projects and assignments, as I took extraordinary care of
samples, equipment, and measurements. During my first work years, I understood the importance of documenting, and communication and leadership skills.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Medical Physics at Creighton University, where I expect to graduate in December 2025. My research focuses on MRI safety in abandoned epicardial leads, a project guided by my advisor, Dr. Nichols. Together, we are exploring potential avenues to test translational forces and torques induced by the static magnetic field of and MRI machine.
In addition to my research, I have embraced roles as a Teaching Assistant for General Physics and Astronomy at Creighton. My teaching philosophy emphasizes fostering curiosity and critical thinking while providing students with a strong foundation in physics. This aligns with my long-standing commitment to education, which began during my time at UDLAP as a tutor and science outreach volunteer.
Outside the lab and classroom, I enjoy creative pursuits such as drawing, photography, and music, playing both guitar and piano. In the same matter, I found working in different spaces allows for development of other skills, that is the example of me working part time during this masters on the library's Makerspace where I honed my creative thinking and help others to archive their creative goals using edge technology. 
I also have a passion for language learning — I speak Spanish and English fluently, have working proficiency in German and always aiming to learn more!

Looking ahead, I am still exploring whether clinical practice or industry applications are the best fit for my career. However, my overarching goal remains clear: to contribute to innovations in medical imaging and nuclear medicine, helping improve patient outcomes through science and technology.
